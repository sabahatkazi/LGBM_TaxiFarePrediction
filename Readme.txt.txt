1. Installation:
   - Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running the following commands:
     ```
     !pip install pandas
     !pip install matplotlib
     !pip install seaborn
     ```

2. Import Libraries:
   - Import the necessary libraries by executing the following code:
     ```
     import pandas as pd
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import seaborn as sns
     sns.set()
     ```

3. Read the Dataset:
   - Load the dataset and display the first 5 rows and columns:
     ```
     df = pd.read_csv('/content/taxi-fares.csv')
     df.head()
     ```

4. Check Dataset Dimensions:
   - Verify the number of rows and columns in the dataset:
     ```
     df.shape
     ```

5. Check for Missing Values:
   - Check for any missing values in the dataset:
     ```
     df.info()
     ```

6. Visualize Passenger Count:
   - Plot a count of passenger counts:
     ```
     sns.countplot(x=df['passenger_count'])
     ```

7. Data Preprocessing:
   - Keep only rows with passenger_count = 1 and remove irrelevant columns:
     ```
     df = df[df['passenger_count'] == 1]
     df = df.drop(['key', 'passenger_count'], axis=1)
     df.head()
     ```

8. Further Data Exploration:
   - Compute correlation between numerical features and fare_amount:
     ```
     numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
     corr_matrix = numeric_df.corr()
     fare_corr = corr_matrix['fare_amount'].sort_values(ascending=False)
     print(fare_corr)
     ```

9. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features like day_of_week, pickup_time, and distance:
     ```
     # Feature engineering code
     ```

10. Remove Irrelevant Columns:
    - Remove columns that are not required for modeling:
      ```
      df.drop(columns=['pickup_datetime', 'pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', 'dropoff_latitude'], inplace=True)
      df.head()
      ```

11. Further Analysis:
    - Analyze the correlation between features and fare_amount:
      ```
      corr_matrix = df.corr()
      corr_matrix["fare_amount"].sort_values(ascending=False)
      ```

12. Final Dataset Description:
    - Describe the final subset of the dataset:
      ```
      df.describe()
      ```

13. Data Filtering:
    - Keep only rows with specific conditions on 'distance' and 'fare_amount':
      ```
      df = df[(df['distance'] > 1.0) & (df['distance'] < 10.0)]
      df = df[(df['fare_amount'] > 0.0) & (df['fare_amount'] < 50.0)]
      df.shape
      ```

14. Further Correlation Analysis:
    - Compute correlation matrix for the filtered dataset:
      ```
      corr_matrix = df.corr()
      corr_matrix["fare_amount"].sort_values(ascending=False)
      ```

15. Install LightGBM:
    - Install the LightGBM library for modeling:
      ```
      !pip install lightgbm
      ```

16. Data Splitting:
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
      ```
      # Splitting code
      ```

17. Model Building:
    - Build and evaluate different regression models:
      ```
      # Model building code
      ```

**Program Design and Architecture:**

The program follows a typical data science workflow, starting with data loading and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. It is structured in a modular manner, with each step encapsulated in a separate code cell, allowing for easy understanding and modification of individual components.

**Dependencies:**

Ensure that all necessary Python libraries mentioned in the installation section are installed and available in your environment (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LightGBM). Additionally, ensure that the dataset file ('taxi-fares.csv') is present in the specified location.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter any errors during execution, double-check that:
- The dataset file path is correct and accessible.
- Required libraries are installed, and there are no compatibility issues.
- Data preprocessing steps are applied correctly and do not result in unexpected data transformations.
- Model building and evaluation steps are executed without errors and produce meaningful results.
